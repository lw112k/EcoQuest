                <h2>The Big Goal 🎯</h2>
                <p>We saw too much single-use plastic around campus, so we built <strong>EcoQuest</strong>! Our primary purpose is to <strong>reduce plastic waste</strong> across the Asia Pacific University campus by incentivizing sustainable behavior through gamification. Confirm fun, confirm effective!</p>
                <p>Every small action, like using a reusable container or <strong>saying "no" to a plastic straw</strong>, is rewarded with <strong>Points</strong>. These points climb you up the Leaderboard and let you redeem cool rewards from the Marketplace.</p>
